# LaggView
LaggView is a minecraft mod that aims to improve the overal quality of gameplay on the Hypixel network. Here's a list of some of the things it provides:
* A HUD to count things like kills or assists in games where that info is not already displayed
* Extremely easy stat lookups just by typing a name
* Automatic stat lookups for players in-game, displayed in the tab-overlay 
* A service that will toggle [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) when approaching a nearby hacker
* An open-source github repository for anyone looking to do similar things!

In the future, I plan to add new features to the mod and to my website (thelagg.com) in order to continue with this goal. If you've got any suggestions on ways I can improve this or any questions on how something was done, feel free to ask. I might not have all the answers, but I'll try my best. :)
